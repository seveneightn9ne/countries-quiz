# Countries Quiz

This is a quiz app where you can add countries and 'properties', like language, capital, etc. And you can quiz yourself on them. The properties can be a list, or text. (List allows you to enter answers one at a time and in any order)

## Todo
* Provide 'default' countries database for import
* Allow 'aliases' for countries (e.g. Burma/Myanmar). (Is this necessary? There are currently no questions that require you to enter a country name)
* Get suggestions from Anna
